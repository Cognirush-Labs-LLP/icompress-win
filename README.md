# Mass Image Compressor - Windows 10 and Above

Mass Image Compressor is a lightweight, fast, and powerful batch image compression tool. This new version is a complete rewrite of the original project hosted at [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/icompress/), redesigned with a modern WinUI 3 interface and built on .NET 8 for Windows 10 and 11.

> **Note:** This project will replace the original Mass Image Compressor for Windows 10/11 after community testing and stabilization. The original Mass Image Compressor (version 3.2+) will still be available for Window 7 users, or as portable image compressor due to its smaller size.
