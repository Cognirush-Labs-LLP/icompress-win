## üì• Download

### Windows 10 and above, Windows Server 2019 and above
Use one of these methods to install Mass Image Compressor.

#### Option 1: SourceForge.net
Download latest unsigned installer from [SourceForge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/icompress/) (free). As the installer is unsigned and releases first, Windows security may kick-in and may have to take additional steps to install this. Choose other options if you are not comfortable. 

#### Option 2: Github or Winget 
You can download the installer from this Github project (see [releases](https://github.com/Cognirush-Labs-LLP/icompress-win/releases)) or use below script to install via winget. 
```bash
winget source update
winget install --id=Cognirush.MassImageCompressor -e
```
More details [here](https://mic.cognirush.com/install-via-winget/)

#### Option 3: Use Microsoft Store
Get signed installer from [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NF6R54S63L3?launch=true&mode=full?cid=git) (one-time cost of a coffee). You get auto-update feature and Windows security is cool with it as the installer is signed.
